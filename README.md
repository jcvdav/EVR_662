# Class description

The course will introduce students to intermediate spatial analysis in R, in the context of Environmental Science and Policy. Introductory knowledge of spatial analysis (*e.g.* GIS using QGIS or ESRI products) is required, as is previous exposure to the use of scripting languages (*e.g.* R or Python). During the first part of the course (weeks 1-6), students will gain a solid foundation on modern tools and standards for spatial analysis in R (*e.g.* simple features, spherical geometries). The second part (weeks 7-15) will expose students to intermediate techniques (*e.g.* interactive visualization, scripting). Students will learn how to find, retrieve, and work with a suite of spatial data products commonly used in Environmental Science and Policy.

> **Undergraduate students** Some seats are reserved for undergraduate students who have some relevant experience and permission. The expectations for undergraduates are slightly more lenient with regards to the final project. All other expectations remain the same.

# Class objectives

At the end of this course, students will: 1. Have a foundational understanding of the principles of spatial analysis in R 2. Be able to identify and access data sources, design and build processing pipelines, and create spatial models related to Environmental Science and Policy

# Pre-requisites

Required: previous exposure to GIS, such as EVR 660. Introduction to Marine Geographic Information Systems. Encouraged: And previous exposure to R / statistics, such as: RSM 612. Statistics for Marine Scientists, EVR 622. Principles and Practices of Marine Social Science Research, or EVR 624. Statistics and Data Analysis for Environmental Science and Policy

# Class materials

-   Will be primarily available on the course website and GitHub repository, but also on UM blackboard.

# Reading resources

# List of assignments (examples)

-   Assig 1: Proof of attempted or successful installation of all required dependencies
-   Assig 2: Manipulation of spatial data in R
-   Assig 3: Visualization of some of your project’s data (see below)
-   Assig 4: Remote sensing

# Individual projects

The individual project is intended to serve two purposes. First, provide the student with an opportunity to apply their newly acquired tools and techniques to their own research or application. And, secondly, to serve as proof of learning. As such, all individual projects will meet the following criteria:

1.  All data and code must be primarily analyzed or processed using R and RStudio (or an equivalent scripting / coding language to be pre-approved by the instructor)

2.  The student will show they have mastered the course material by correctly and successfully employing two tools and techniques covered in part 1 of the course and two tools and techniques covered in part 2 of the course.

3.  The final product will be a 5-7 page report (and a 5-7 slide presentation), roughly divided as follows:

-   \~1 page (slide) explaining the objective of the project

-   \~1 page (slide) describing relevant data sources

-   2-3 pages (slides) clearly outlining the tools and techniques used for the project, and a justification for their choice.

-   \~1 page (slide) describing the main outcome of the project (the outcome may be anything a carefully curated dataset to be used at a later stage in the student’s research, preliminary results, or finalized results)

Note that references, appendices, and notes are not included in the page limit.
