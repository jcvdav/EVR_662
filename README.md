# Class description
The course will introduce students to intermediate spatial analysis in R, in the context of Environmental Science and Policy. Introductory knowledge of spatial analysis (e.g. GIS sing QGIS or ESRI products) is required, previous exposure to the use of scripting languages (e.g. R or Python) will help, but is not required. During the first part of the course (weeks 1-6), students will gain a solid foundation on modern tools and standards for spatial analysis in R (e.g. simple features, spherical geometries). The second part (weeks 7-15) will expose students to intermediate techniques (e.g. visualization, scripting, and principles of classification for remote sensing). Students will learn how to find, retrieve, and work with a suite of spatial data products commonly used in Environmental Science and Policy.

> **Undergraduate students:** Some seats are reserved for undergraduate students who have some relevant experience and permission. The expectations for undergraduates are slightly more lenient with regards to the final project. All other expectations remain the same.

# Class objectives
At the end of this course, students will:
1.	Have a foundational understanding of the principles of spatial analysis in R
2.	Be able to identify and access data sources, design and build processing pipelines, and create spatial models related to Environmental Science and Policy

# Pre-requisites
Required: previous exposure to GIS, such as EVR 660. Introduction to Marine Geographic Information Systems. Encouraged: And previous exposure to R / statistics, such as: RSM 612. Statistics for Marine Scientists, EVR 622. Principles and Practices of Marine Social Science Research, or EVR 624. Statistics and Data Analysis for Environmental Science and Policy
