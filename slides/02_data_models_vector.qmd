# Introduction

## How do we get the world into a computer?

- Imagine an attribute that occurs somewhere in the World:
    - SST
    - site identity
    - hurricane path
    - city boundaries
- How do we represent it?
- How do we work on it?
- How do we store the data?

## We need a *model*

Data can be represented in a `vector` model, or a `raster` model

In today's class:

- Introduce the *why* behind each model
- Discuss where and when they are used
- Focus on `vector`:
    - It's main attributes
    - It's implementation in R
    
## Today's goals

By the end of the lecture, you should be able to:

- list the two main data models, and articulate their main characteristics
- understand the principles of `vector` data
- list the three main components of a spatial `vector` object
- list the tree main types of a _simple feature_
- given an `sf` object, plot it and inspect it


## Two models
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### `vector`
- World is represented using geometries: points, lines, and polygons
- Discrete and well-defined borders = high precision
- Computationally intensive
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### `raster`
- Space is divided into equal-sized grid cells (or pixels)
- Aggregate spatial features to a given *resolution*
- You can lose some precision, but much faster to work with

## Example: Rosenstiel {.scrollable}

:::: {.panel-tabset}

### Point (1D)

```{r point-example}
# Build the "spatial" part
rsmaes_pt_coords <- st_point(x = c(-80.1632879, 25.7328129),
                             dim = "XY") |> 
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)
# Combine with the "attributes" part
rsmaes_pt <- st_sf(id = "Rosenstiel (point)",
                   geometry = rsmaes_pt_coords)
# Visualize
mapview(rsmaes_pt)
```

### Line (2D)

```{r line-example}
rsmaes_line_coords <- st_linestring(
  x = matrix(data = c(-80.163017, 25.733950,
                      -80.164236, 25.732816,
                      -80.163772, 25.732353,
                      -80.163924, 25.732148,
                      -80.163455, 25.731597,
                      -80.162187, 25.731605,
                      -80.160968, 25.732172,
                      -80.163017, 25.733950),
             ncol = 2,
             byrow = T),
  dim = "XY") |> 
  list() |> 
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)

rsmaes_line <- st_sf(id = "Rosenstiel (line)",
                     geometry = rsmaes_line_coords)

mapview(rsmaes_line)
```

### Polygon (3D)

```{r polygon-example}
rsmaes_poly_coords <- st_polygon(
  x = list(
    matrix(
      data = c(
        -80.163017, 25.733950,
        -80.164236, 25.732816,
        -80.163772, 25.732353,
        -80.163924, 25.732148,
        -80.163455, 25.731597,
        -80.162187, 25.731605,
        -80.160968, 25.732172,
        -80.163017, 25.733950),
      ncol = 2,
      byrow = T)),
  dim = "XY") |> 
  st_sfc(crs = 4326)

rsmaes_poly <- st_sf(id = "Rosenstiel (polygon)",
                     geometry = rsmaes_poly_coords)

mapview(rsmaes_poly)
```


### Raster
```{r raster-example}
rsmaes_rast <- rasterize(
  x = vect(rsmaes_poly),
  y = rast(resolution = 0.0001,
           crs = "EPSG:4326",
           val = 0,
           xmin = -80.168, xmax = -80.155,
           ymin = 25.730, ymax = 25.735),
  field = 1)

names(rsmaes_rast) <- "Rosenstiel"
rsmaes_rast[is.na(rsmaes_rast)] <- 0

mapview(rsmaes_rast,
        legend = F)
```

## Common uses
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### `vector`
- Common in social sciences:
    - Census tract boundaries
    - Political boundaries
    - Roads
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### `raster`
- Common in natural sciences:
    - Sea surface temperature
    - Satellite imagery
    - Species distribution models
:::

::::

- As environmental scientists and practitioners we will typically use both

- The "correct" type of data varies by use case

- You'll be able to make this choice in a few weeks

> "`raster` is faster, but `vector` is correctr"

## Vector data model

> World is represented using geometries: points, lines, and polygons

. . .

**Q:** What is a line? What is a polygon?

. . .

**A:** A sequence of points

. . .

**Q:** How do we represent a point?

. . .

**A:** Coordinates

. . .

**Q:** What are coordinates?

. . .

**A:** Two numbers representing distance from an **origin**: a coordinate reference system

. . .


::: {.callout-note}

The vector data model is based on points located within a coordinate reference system (CRS)

:::


# What is where? And what does "where" mean?

Coordinates, Coordinate Reference Systems, and Attributes

## What does "where" mean?


Consider the following two coordinates:

- `(-80.1632879, 25.7328129)`

- `(1186764, 2863941)`

. . .

Where are they?

. . .

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rsmaes_pt_coords <- st_point(x = c(-80.1632879, 25.7328129),
                             dim = "XY") |> 
  st_sfc(crs = "EPSG:4326")

p1 <- ggplot() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_sf(data = rnaturalearth::ne_states(geounit = "United States of America") |> 
            filter(name == "Florida")) +
  geom_sf(data = rsmaes_pt_coords)

p2 <- p1 + 
  coord_sf(crs = "EPSG:26916",
           datum = st_crs("EPSG:26916")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol = 2, rel_widths = c(3, 1))
```

## The importance of attributes

- Coordinates and a CRS are enough to place the point on a map
- Also enough to perform spatial analysis
- But not enough to convey *information* about the location
- Often not enough to derive insights
- We also need attributes

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
The three main components of a spatial `vector` object are attributes (what), geometry, and CRS (where)
:::

## Attributes

- Are not inherently spatial
- Can be a discrete or categorical variable representing a characteristic of interest:
    - Identity
    - Sea Surface Temperature
    - Time
- Note that you can have more than one attribute tied to a geometry
    - 2 attributes: vessel-tracking data or hurricane path (id and time)
    - 2+ attributes: Buoy weather data (id, time, and all variables measured)

# Handling spatial data in a computer

## How are these compotents handled in a computer?

We rely on four key low-level libraries for geocomputation:

- `GDAL`: read, write, and manipulating geographic data
- `PROJ`: coordinate system transformation
- `GEOS`: **planar** geometry engine only to be used with data with a _projected_ CRS)
- **`S2`**: a **spherical** geometry engine, written in C++ (fast) and developed by Google (reliable)

. . .

All are incredibly powerful and open source, but not exactly user-friendly

## Ways of interacting with these libraries

![](img/cli_and_gui.png)

## The `sf` package

- From R, our main point of access will be the `sf` package
- When we load `sf`, it automatically links to these low level libraries

. . .

```{.r}
library(sf)
```

```
Linking to GEOS 3.13.0, GDAL 3.10.0, PROJ 9.5.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE
```

. . .

- `sf` provides:
    - A consistent command-line interface to communicate with the libraries
    - R classes and objects to handle `vector` data using the _Simple Feature_ standard

# Introduction to Simple Features

## Simple Features

- Simple feature is an official, open  [_standard_](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html) (_i.e._ registered at the ISO)
- Hierarchical data model to represent types of geometries (_i.e._ points, lines, polygons, multi-, and collections)

. . .

The standard says: 

> “A simple feature is defined by the OpenGIS Abstract specification to have both spatial and non-spatial attributes. Spatial attributes are geometry valued, and simple features are based on 2D geometry with linear interpolation between vertices.”

—Pebesma, 2024

## Working with `sf` objects in R

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
col_names <- names(read_csv("https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/international-best-track-archive-for-climate-stewardship-ibtracs/v04r01/access/csv/ibtracs.last3years.list.v04r01.csv", n_max = 0))
hur <- read_csv("https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/international-best-track-archive-for-climate-stewardship-ibtracs/v04r01/access/csv/ibtracs.last3years.list.v04r01.csv",
                col_names = col_names,
                skip = 2) |> 
  filter(NAME == "MILTON") |> 
  mutate(DIST2LAND = as.numeric(DIST2LAND)) |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("LON", "LAT"),
           crs = 4326) |> 
  select(NAME, ISO_TIME, USA_WIND, USA_PRES, USA_SSHS)

st_write(obj = hur,
         dsn = here("data", "milton.gpkg"),
         delete_dsn = T)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
# Read the data
milton <- read_sf(here("data", "milton.gpkg"), quiet = T)

# Inspect it
class(milton)

# See its names
names(milton)

# Plot it (note you get one plot per column, except for geometry)
plot(milton)
```

## Using `sf` object as a `data.frame` {.scrollable}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

You can quickly calculate summary statistics for any attribute variable

```{r}
summary(milton$USA_WIND)
```

Keep only some columns

```{r}
milton_light <- milton[,c(2, 3)]
milton_light
```


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Or plot the attribute variables

```{r}
ggplot(data = milton_light,
       mapping = aes(x = ISO_TIME,
                     y = USA_WIND)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Maximum sustained wind speed (knots)")
```

# Why simple features

- **STANDARD** = transferability and reproducibility
- Relatively quick
- Intergrated pipeline for data manipulation and visualiztion (tibbles and data.frames)
- 

# Basic maps

# Geometry types

## The main^[Other less common types include `CIRCULARSTRING`, `COMPOUNDCURVE`, `CURVEPOLYGON`, `MULTICURVE`, `MULTISURFACE`, `CURVE`, `SURFACE`, `POLYHEDRALSURFACE`, `TIN`] types of simple features

- `POINT`	zero-dimensional geometry containing a single point
- `LINESTRING`	sequence of points connected by straight, non-self intersecting line pieces; one-dimensional geometry
- `POLYGON`	geometry with a positive area (two-dimensional); sequence of points form a closed, non-self intersecting ring; the first ring `denotes` the exterior ring, zero or more subsequent rings denote holes in this exterior ring
- `MULTIPOINT`	set of points
- `MULTILINESTRING`	set of linestrings
- `MULTIPOLYGON`	set of polygons
- `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` set of geometries of any type except `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`

```{r}
#| code-fold: false

rsmaes_pt <- c(-80.1632879, 25.7328129) |>      # Coordinates

# Simple feature geometries (`sfg`)

# Simple feature columngs (`sfc`)

# Working with `sf` objects

## Main points
- There are two models with which we represent spatial data (`vector` and `raster`)
- The `vector` model relies on `simple features`: points, lines, and polygons (coordinates)
- `sf` is the main R package for working with vector data
- an `sf` object should have three things:
    - attributes (what: data frame)
    - features (where: geometry column)
    - CRS (in relation to what?: in the header)
