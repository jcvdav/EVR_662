# About the class

## Introductions and expectations

## The (general) instruction format

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Lecture sessions (Mondays)
- Slide-based delivery of content
- Emphasis on the _why_ of an approach
- The first few might feel tedious and boring
- It will be important that you do the assigned readings
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Hands-on sessions (Wednesdays)
- No slides, mostly live coding (you follow along)
- Emphasis on _how_ of an approach
- 90% of troubleshooting will ocur during the first sessions
- We will work towards finding a balance of content and time for you to get things done

### Part 2 (weeks 7-15)

- Focus on techniques
- Visualization
- Functions, pipelines, and scripting

## Grading
- Lab exercise and attendance: 20%
- Assignments: 30%
- Midterm exam: 10%
- Individual project: 40%

## Lab exercise and attendance (20%)
- These are the Wednesdays hands-on days
- We will be coding side-by-side and you should get these done at the same time as I do
- Basically, 20% of your grade for free

## Assignments (30%)
- There will be 3-4 short assignments
- Designed to gauge whether you are up to speed
- You will submit them via email to me at jc_villasenor@miami.edu

## Exams (10%)
- Midterm exam only
- _Likely_ take-home, date TBD
- A combination of theory (quesitons) and practice (coding problems)

## Final project (40%)
We will design a project where you will apply your newly acquired tools and techniques to your own research or application. As such, individual projects will meet the following criteria:

1. All data and code must be primarily analyzed or processed using R and RStudio
2. The student will show they have mastered the course material by correctly and successfully employing **two tools and techniques covered in part 1 of the course and two tools and techniques covered in part 2 of the course**.
3. The final product will be a 5-7 page report and a 5-7 slide presentation

# Striving for standardization

## Working in RStudio Server
- I've installed RStudio Server in a computational server
- We will all be working in the same environment (at least during classes)
- (Hopefully) help us reduce debugging different environments
- Only worth it if it gives us _less_ headaches than each of us using our own machines
- You are welcome to use your own machine


## Accessing the server

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Navigate to: http://10.97.0.166:8787/^[For reference 10.97.0.166 is the IP address, 8787 is the port]
- **Can only be accessed while on campus**
- Your username is your CANE id
- Your temporary password is `evr662`, we will change it in a second

## Updating passwords

- Log in to your user account
- Open the Terminal window
- Type `passwd` and press Enter
- Enter your **current** password (`evr662`) and press Enter
- Enter your _new_ password and press Enter
- Immediately add your new password it to your password manager of choice!
- You should see "Password updated successfully" in the terminal


## Modify the appearance

- Panes
- Pipe
- Directory

## Testing the server

### Part 1: Server

a. Copy the code below and run it on your session in the server (one line at a time)


```{r, eval = FALSE}
#| code-fold: false
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("terra")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
```

b. In R, run `installed.packages()`, copy the output, and paste it in an R script called `Lastname_assig1.R` (e.g. `Villasenor_assig1.R`).
c. In R, run `sessionInfo()` and copy the output to the same R script

### Part 2: On your own computer

- Download and install the latest version of R (currently v 4.4.x)
    - [MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
    - [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
- Download and install the latest version of [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- Repeat steps a-c above, but this time on your computer (I anticipate you will not be able to get it up and running, that's fine, I just want you to try)

:::

:::

:::

- Send me your Rscript via email: jc_villasenor@miami.edu before class starts on Wednesday

- I will grade you on evidence of trying (100%, submitted) or not enough evidence of trying (0%, not submitted)
